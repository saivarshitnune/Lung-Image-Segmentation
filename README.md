# Lung Image Segmentation Using VGG16-UNet Architecture

 # Objective
The primary goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model for the binary segmentation of lung images. This segmentation aims to accurately delineate lung regions from the background in medical images, which is crucial for various diagnostic and treatment planning applications.


# Methodology
To achieve high performance in segmentation, we employed a modified UNet architecture, integrating VGG16 as the encoder. The choice of VGG16, a well-known convolutional neural network, allows leveraging its pre-trained weights and robust feature extraction capabilities. The decoder part of the UNet remains unchanged, ensuring effective upsampling and reconstruction of the segmented lung regions.

# Model Architecture
 Encoder: VGG16, pre-trained on ImageNet, replaces the original UNet encoding layers. The encoder's task is to capture and downsample the spatial features of the input lung images.
 Decoder: The standard UNet decoding layers are retained, which upsample the features and generate the final segmentation mask.


# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation comprises 1228 lung images paired with corresponding binary masks indicating the lung regions. These images are preprocessed to standardize size and intensity values.


# Training and Evaluation
The model was trained using a combination of Binary class entropy and dice loss to enhance its generalization capabilities. The primary evaluation metric for the segmentation performance was the Dice coefficient, a measure of overlap between the predicted and ground truth masks.


# Conclusion
The VGG16-UNet model achieved a Dice score of 0.71 on the test set, indicating a good level of accuracy in segmenting lung regions from the background. This result demonstrates the model's potential for assisting in medical image analysis tasks.
